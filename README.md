# Wrangling and Analyzing @WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

In this project, I gather data on @WeRateDogs tweets. I willclean this daate and perform some analysis. 

@WeRateDogs is a twitter account that rates dog pictures and videos. I have the archive data for this account, but it comes with various 
tidyness and Quality issues. The archive is also missing some crucial features. The goal of this project is to identify as many issues as 
possible and rectify the.

The wrangling efforts and analysis are included in the `wrangle_act.ipynb` jupyter notebook.
